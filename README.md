## Inspiration
Our journey with Info Checker began with a curiosity about the latest advancements in technology, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like those developed by OpenAI, and innovative communication solutions such as Whisper. These discoveries inspired us to create a tool that could help combat misinformation online.

## What it does
Info Checker simplifies the process of verifying information found online. Users can upload text, audio, or video files, and Info Checker will analyze the content by searching for relevant information using Google links. These links are then processed through the Gemini API to determine the credibility of the information.

## How we built it
We implemented Info Checker using Gradio, a Python library that simplifies the creation of web interfaces for machine learning and data processing tasks. With Gradio, we seamlessly integrated our Python backend with a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to interact with Info Checker easily. Gradio's intuitive API enabled us to design functionalities such as file upload, result display, and interaction with external APIs effortlessly. By leveraging Gradio, we accelerated the development process, ensuring that Info Checker provides a smooth and intuitive user experience while effectively verifying online information.

## Challenges we ran into
Understanding the intricacies of LLMs and integrating Whisper into our platform presented challenges. We had to experiment with different approaches and overcome technical hurdles to ensure smooth functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a simple yet effective tool for verifying information online. Info Checker provides users with a reliable solution to combat misinformation and make informed decisions.

## What we learned
Through building Info Checker, we gained valuable insights into LLMs, API integration, and user interface design. We also learned about the importance of reliable fact-checking tools in today's digital age.

## What's next for Info Checker
In the future, we plan to further refine Info Checker's capabilities, improve its accuracy, and expand its functionality to support additional file formats. Our goal is to continue empowering users with the tools they need to navigate the digital world confidently and responsibly.
